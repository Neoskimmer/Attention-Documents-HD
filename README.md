# Attention-Documents-HD (ADHD)
A word processor (Like Word or Google Docs) that focuses on helping people with ADHD stay productive.

# Features

## .adhd file format.
ADHD saves and opens documents in the .adhd file format.

(I'll be honest, it's just plain text but with a .adhd file extention.)

## Built-in fidgets

ADHD has multiple on-screen  'fidgets' (such as sliders, keystroke visualisers and more) to help your brain stimulate itself while it's thinking about your next paragraph.

## Calendars & notifications

ADHD has an built-in calendar that sends a notification to your device when something is near it's due date, or just a reminder for you to start working.

It can also send notifications to your device if you spend a certain amount of time on a different window.
